      <description>2020 has been a very special and challenging year. By working remotely throughout the year, a lot of thing has been changed such as new working environment, new projects, and most importantly new work-life balance. I am very lucky to find this work very well myself.
Not only I can work much more productive, but also have chance to take a pause to think out of the box. I found myself more outgoing and enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience.</description>
